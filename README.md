# bumbread-theme-colored

The second version of my theme, this one has more colors. It's not as pretty as before in terms of consistency, e.g. keeping selections red and the results of search results green, but it does have some of the same charm as one of the themes I found on the other marketplace.

Recommended settings.json additions:

```json
{
    "workbench.editor.decorations.colors": false,
    "workbench.editor.decorations.badges": false,
    "git.decorations.enabled": false,
    "editor.bracketPairColorization.enabled": false,
}
```
